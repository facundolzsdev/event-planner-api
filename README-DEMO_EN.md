## Upcoming Updates:

### 1. Explanatory Videos.
I will upload a series of videos demonstrating each endpoint, the functioning of JWT and roles, among other relevant explanations.     
(I'll put the link in the project documentation).
<br>
### 2. Swagger Integration. (✅ Completed)
I will add interactive documentation at `/swagger-ui.html`
with the complete list of endpoints, browser tests, and request/response examples.
<br>
### 3. Tests.
Finally, I will add integration tests with `@SpringBootTest`, covering critical logic (auth, services).
